This repository consists of the tasks that I have gone through with this intern.

At the spark foundation, I have been selected as Data science and Business analytics intern, where I have been given with some tasks, so that this repository consists of the task that I have gone through this intern.

                       Task 1 : Prediction using supervised machine learning algorithm


Task 1 : Prediction using supervised machine learning algorithm
Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours, this is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. This task is implemented by using both sklearn and from scratch, in the program from scratch, the model is implemented and the cost function of the model is calculated and it is further optimized using gradient descent algorithm, and the model is evaluated using the following metrics :

Mean squared error
Root mean squared error
R2 error.
According to the task query, it is said to predict the student score when he studies at a rate of 9.25 hours per day.

So, the results are :

Based on the implementation from sklearn if a student studies 9.25 hrs a day he will score : 89.99093062789352
Based on the implementation from scratch if a student studies 9.25 hrs a day he will score : 92.97420126293007
